Introduction to Quantum Information and Image Processing
    
    Before starting Information Processing its best to understand how quantum computing works and how to access and execute the information, The core items are below
        
        1. Basic Atomic Structure

        2. Photon wave
        3. Electron Fluctuation
        4. States
        5. SuperPosition
        6. SuperPosition specific for information processing
        7. Classical Bit
        8. Quantum Bit or Qubit or Qbit
        9. How to read and write data
